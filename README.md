# Cuisine Classification
A regionâ€™s local style of food is usually associated with strong geographical and cultural implications. Our group wonders if this type of associations can be systematically investigated through a machine learning approach. Specifically, we are interested in building predictive models that perform cuisine classification of recipes given a list of their ingredients. In this project, we will be using a large set of recipes provided by Yummly.
