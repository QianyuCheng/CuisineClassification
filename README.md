# Cuisine Classification
A regionâ€™s local style of food is usually associated with strong geographical and cultural implications. In this project, the team wonders if this type of associations can be systematically investigated through a machine learning approach.   
Specifically, the team is trying to building predictive models that perform cuisine classification of recipes given a list of their ingredients. The dataset is generously provided by Yummly.
